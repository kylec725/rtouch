# rtouch
rtouch is a recursive touch utility designed to touch existing files, or create
new files while making the required directories for the new file.

rtouch is inspired by [Advanced New File](https://github.com/tanrax/terminal-AdvancedNewFile)

## Usage
```
rtouch path1/file1 path2/file2 ... pathn/filen
```

## TODO
- Add existing touch command flags
